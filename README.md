# The Best Timer

## Why?
Because it was made with love and effort. Also it has a great design :D

## How can I use it?

Well this is simple, you have two ways

### Using the URL

You can change the values by changing the URL.

`timer/1min2sec`

or

`timer/1minute2seconds`

### Using the arrow keys

You will see a help text on the corner that will lead you through the commands

## Can I use it with my phone?

Of course, but you only will be able to change the values using the URL method and touching the screen to start or pause the timer.
